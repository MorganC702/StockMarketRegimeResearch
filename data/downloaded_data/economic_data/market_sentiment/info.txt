Series is calculated as the spread between 3-Month LIBOR based on US dollars (USD3MTD156N) and 3-Month Treasury Bill (DTB3).
Starting with the update on June 21, 2019, the Treasury bond data used in calculating interest rate spreads is obtained directly from the U.S. Treasury Department.

The 3-Month LIBOR based on US Dollars has been removed from FRED as of January 31, 2022, so this calculated series has been discontinued and will no longer be updated. Users interested in calculating a similar credit risk can use the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which has been identified as the rate that represents best practice for use in certain new U.S. Dollar derivatives and other financial contracts. For more details, see the article Transition from LIBOR from the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (AARC).

The STLFSI4 measures the degree of financial stress in the markets and is constructed from 18 weekly data series: seven interest rate series, six yield spreads and five other indicators. Each of these variables captures some aspect of financial stress. Accordingly, as the level of financial stress in the economy changes, the data series are likely to move together.

How to Interpret the Index:
The average value of the index, which begins in late 1993, is designed to be zero. Thus, zero is viewed as representing normal financial market conditions. Values below zero suggest below-average financial market stress, while values above zero suggest above-average financial market stress.
